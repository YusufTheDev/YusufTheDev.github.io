                <h3>Focus Forge</h3>
                <p>FocusForge is a productivity tool created during a build-a-thon with the goal of supporting
                    individuals
                    with ADHD. Designed with an intuitive interface and customizable features, FocusForge helps users
                    stay
                    organized, manage tasks, and maintain focus. The challenge of the build-a-thon was to create a
                    product
                    in under 24 hours, and due to this, a static game was made using html, css and js. </p>
